# More Tools
A lightweight Minecraft mod that expands the game's tool/equipment system, starting with the new copper equipment introduced in Minecraft 1.21.9.

## Current Features (v1.1.1)
- Fully implemented **Copper Equipment Set** (aligned with Minecraft 1.21.9's official design):
  - Copper Sword (balanced damage/durability between wooden and iron swords)
  - Copper Pickaxe (mines stone/coal faster than wooden pickaxe, with moderate durability)
  - Copper Axe (efficient for chopping wood, slight bonus to oak/spruce logs)
  - Copper Shovel (improved sand/gravel mining speed)
  - Copper Armor Set (Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, Boots)
    - Provides better protection than leather armor
- All copper equipment uses vanilla Minecraft crafting recipes (consistent with 1.21.9's copper item crafting logic)

## Development Status
✅ Implemented: Copper equipment (full set) from Minecraft 1.21.9  
🚧 In Progress: Additional tool/equipment types (TBD)  
❌ Not Started: Other tools and equipment

## Requirements
- Minecraft Java Edition: 1.21.1  
- Mod Loader: NeoForge 21.1.x (compatible with 1.21.1)

## Crafting Recipes (Vanilla-Compatible)

- Copper Pickaxe: 3x Copper Ingots + 2x Sticks  
- Copper Armor: 8x Copper Ingots (for full set, standard armor crafting layout)  

## Future Plans
